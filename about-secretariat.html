                    ‚ÄúJonathaning around (verb) - To fool around in a uniquely Jonathan way‚Äù ~ Oxford (TZH) Dictionary 
<br><br>
 Contrary to popular belief, Jonathan is not as scary as he seems, and is often found influencing his peers to do quirky things, such as nerf gun battles in school. Besides his love for tea (brewed, not really spoken), Jonathan can be found watching ghost movies, reading spine chilling mystery novels, or just chilling during his scarce free time. With the motto of making HCCRI‚Äô23 the wildest yet academically rigorous conference to date, Jonathan hopes to create an unforgettable and memorable conference for everyone, while embracing ‚Äúin motion (emotion), chaos‚Äù

                    Shanice's favourite thing about going for a conference for the second time in a row is being able to reuse her bio from the previous year, so here goes! 
<br><br>
She likes to tell everyone that she has a cloud-shaped birthmark as a fun fact. Most of her short spurts of motivation have led her to having a repertoire of not-entirely-useful experiences, like trying to replicate the world‚Äôs longest-flying paper aeroplane, and being able to list facts about false blister beetles (did you know their cantharidin was often thought of as an aphrodisiac?). More seriously, she looks forward to HCCRI and working with her very talented CM team, and hopes that delegates will be able to form new memories and friendships in this conference!

                    Matthew is a quirky J2 student whose subject combination reflects his will to live (he is a KIELME student). Apart from engaging in circular philosophical debates and crying rivers of tears over metaphors and hyperboles, he also enjoys long walks by himself (he swears he has friends) to remote places in Singapore and photography. 
<br><br>
As USG ü™µü™µü™µ, he will ensure that your conference materials are delivered smoothly, while incessantly pestering his fellow USG Xiran over the smallest of things. He hopes delegates will have a fun time at HCCRI!

                    After her delegates questioned her why she did not have a cup of coffee in her hands during her previous MUN conference, Xiran has decided to stop her unhealthy obsession with caffeine. She can be seen in the National Library working on her translation homework which takes at least three hours to complete every weekend. While her friends tell her she can't be bribed, she suggests you can try to bribe her with StellaLou merchandiseüê∞ 
<br><br>
While not so thrilled at being bugged by fellow USG Matthew 24/7 over trivialities, Xiran is nonetheless honoured to be part of this marvelous CM team. She hopes that all delegates will have a great time at HCCRI.

                    Yihan, as a decidedly art-oriented student, often spends her maths lessons contemplating why didn't she take pure art. She is passionate about international relations and Chinese literature. Reading and writing are her all time favorite, but they often take place at night, by night she meant 2am+ because that‚Äôs the time when yihan's brain finally decides to activate itself. Unhealthy habit, not advised. Yihan is also very invested in looking for good food and improving her makeup skills. üíÖ
<br><br>
As a fledgling in the field, yihan is so lucky to be able to work with her brilliant colleagues and learn from them. She's in full optimism that the conference will be a meaningful and unforgettable one for all. ü•Ç

                    Qian Lin has begun almost every self introduction with updates on her sleep/coffee addiction journey, and she is pleased to announce that she has successfully fought off her coffee addiction, and is striving to right her sleep schedule! While she's not mugging or talking her friends' ears off, she is on the hunt for good food (recommendations are welcome) and the cats around her neighbourhood. 
<br><br>
With HCCRI being (hopefully) her last conference, she is delighted to retiremun having been part of an incredible CM team. She hopes that all delegates will enjoy themselves here and walk away having learnt something new!

                    Rosaline is an extremely exhausted (alliteration!) JC2 HELM student who can be found studying in school or napping. When not chronically on Cookie Clicker, they write critical commentaries on how a high population density impacts the public transport system (TEL is superior). 
<br><br>
Just like how a cookie and the Circle Line is round, they find it extremely fitting to have come full circle. From delling at HCCRI 2019, chairing at HCCRI 2022 and finally DSG for HCCRI 2023; Rosaline is honoured to have started and (hopefully) ended their MUN career here. Lastly, they hope that every delegate has a meaningful and unforgettable time at HCCRI 2023!

                    When you are seeing this, Kang Zheng may either be: weeding out spider mites on his pandan, rushing out his German coursework, or wondering how we all got here. If there‚Äôs one thing you need to know about him, it's that he's willing to learn‚Ä¶ by watching YouTube‚Ä¶ which may not be the most ideal thing to do in an A-level year.
<br><br>
So! To all delegates, Kang Zheng hopes that you will share the same passion with which he learnt about drones, pharmaceuticals and the Rajya Sabha together with his chairs. Which you will see when you join the conference‚Ä¶ and collapse the wave function‚Ä¶ or something something quantum something‚Ä¶

                    Lucas' MUN journey can be summed up succinctly with three iconic memories shared by most in the circuit: ‚Äúsparring in unmods‚Äù, ‚Äúsmoking in GSLs‚Äù and ‚Äúlate night council dinners‚Äù. As he steps into retiremun with HCCRI being his last conference (for real), he is glad to have spent his 4 years of MUN meaningfully and to end his MUN journey with his team of wonderful chairs. 
<br><br>
He hopes that delegates would have a dynamic and stimulating experience at the conference, and also make long-lasting friendships along the way. Finally he would like to wish crisis delegates specifically all the best for the series of ups and downs ahead for them!

                    As a J2 student, Yee Cun's weekly Canva screen time average has increased to 5 hours a week, which is about 5 hours more than the amount of time she spends on her CSC independent study (she promises her mentor she will start as soon as possible).
<br><br>
As she marvels over her own designs, Yee Cun hopes that delegates will enjoy the content on the HCCRI Instagram feed, and that all delegates will have a fulfilling time at HCCRI this year :‚Äù

                    When she isn't pouring over history notes or trying to make headway on her Goodreads reading goal for the year, Xiaoyuan spends her time going down the infinite rabbit hole of Canva templates while lamenting at how difficult it is to multi-select elements on the iPad app. Unfortunately, a situation as such occurs far too often during econs lessons.
<br><br>
Despite not being a MUNner herself, Xiaoyuan is grateful to be a part of such a talented outreach team, and hopes that the publicity designs can contribute to delegates' enjoyment at HCCRI!

                    As a BCME student, Youqi constantly tries to find new personality traits to spice up her otherwise extremely basic life. How basic, you might wonder? Well, she once did buzzfeed quizzes on movie characters (during a GP lesson) and got ‚Äúfunny side-character‚Äù and ‚Äúfunny best friend‚Äù. (she is not ok) (but hey at least she's funny right) 
<br><br>
And that is why she will be making being in SP her new personality trait üòç and is hoping that the delegates will have a fun time at HCCRI! üôå
